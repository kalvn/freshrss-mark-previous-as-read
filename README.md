# FreshRSS extension - Mark Previous as Read
This extension adds a button in the footer of each entry. Clicking this button will mark all previous entries belonging to the current feed, as read.

The goal is, when going through a very long list of entries without reading them all, to be able to mark as read what was went through, and continue later.

## Installation
Download the code and copy directory `xExtension-MarkPreviousAsRead` into the `extensions/` directory of your FreshRSS installation.

Then, in the settings menu, select **Extensions** and enable **Mark Previous as Read**.
